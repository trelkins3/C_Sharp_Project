# C_Sharp_Project
Playing around with C# to learn. End goal is to make a simple game or useful application with C#, maybe with a dash of C#.NET. 

Training/tutorial materials go under 'experimental' (make sure to provide a link to the tutorial and credit where credit is due).

Actual project work goes under 'proj'.

Write code in your own branch, then merge to develop. Alternatively, pushing to develop is acceptable if communicated effectively. We want to triple check code before we merge into master as a matter of workflow best practices.
